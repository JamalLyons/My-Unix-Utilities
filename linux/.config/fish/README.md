# Fish

The [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) is one of my favorite features of using linux as a programmer.
Here is some of my setup-config or plugin information I use with fish.

## Note

This only added the .config file for my fish shell, all you have to do is copy in paste this into the old one (in the right places for your system) and it will work with my plugins. Please install the items below to get this working:

## Plugins

# Terminal

Hello Internet, This repo is a place for me to keep all my terminal scripts for linux, windows, and more. So whenever I update or change computers i have one place I can find all my scripts. 

## Dirs

The first directory is the [Themes](./themes) folder. It contains my setup scrips for [oh-my-posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/), and other theme setups for my terminal.

The second is my [git](./git) folder for any github actions to help automate my terminal.

# Terminal

Hello Internet, This repo is a place for me to keep all my terminal scripts for linux, windows, and more. So whenever I update or change computers i have one place I can find all my scripts.

# Windows > Theme > Powershell

This folder has my theme configuration for my powershell terminal.

The new theme im using in windows right now is [Starship shell](https://starship.rs/).

# Linux > automation > Pop OS

POP OS scripts.
